* Charged particle in an electric field sees a force
* one volt is 1J/1C

U = qV

U - energy gained by a charged particle when in a potential (V)

If all of this energy is converted to E<sub>k</sub>

U = qV = 0.5mv<sup>2</sup>


v<sup>2</sup = 2qV/m

v = sqrt(2qV/m)   <-- velocity of a charged particle accelerated by potential V

* ignore sign of q.
* True for non-relativistic speeds.

### Example
Electron accelerates through 50V, what is v?

e = 1.6x10<sup>-19</sup>

v = 4.19x10<sup>6</sup>ms<sup>-1</sup>

How much V for relativistic speeds?

relativistic effects kick in at about 0.1C

V = v<sup>2</sup>m/2e

=2562V

## The electron Volt
An electron volt is the energy gained by one electron when accelerated by 1V.

E = qV

1eV = 1.6x10<sup>-19</sup>

### Example
What is the velocity of an electron with kE = 5eV

v = sqrt(2E/m)

 = sqrt(2(5)(1.6x10<sup>-19</sup>)/9.11x10<sup>-31</sup>)

v = 1.33x10<sup>6</sup>ms<sup>-1</sup>

## Motion in a uniform E-field
-ev particle enters electric field between 2 charged parallel plates.

F = q<sub>e</sub>q<sub>f</sup>/4&pi;&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>v

F=ma

ma = qE

a = qE/m

particle experiences acceleration, deflection either opposite E-field for a
negative charge, or along E-field for a positive charge.

## Charges moving in magnetic fields
Force on a moving particle in a B-field

F = Bqv.sin&theta;

&theta; = angle between v and B

for &theta; = 90:

r = mv/qB ,   f = qB/2&pi;m

Charged particles travelling with v = E/B experience no net force through
crossed E and B fields.
