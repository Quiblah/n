## Kepler's Laws
### First
> Each planet moves in an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus of the
> ellipse.

a, the semi major axis is the longest side of the ellipse

The eccentricity is how far from a circle the orbit is.

### Second
> A line from the sun to a given planet sweeps out an equal area in equal time.

-Planets move faster when they are closer to the sun.

This is about conservation of energy.

### Third
> Periods of the planet orbits are proportional to the 3/2 powers of the
> semi-major axis length.

T<sup>2</sup> = Pa<sup>3</sup>

T = 2&pi;a<sup>3/2</sup>  /  sqrt(GMs)

(where a is the semi-major axis)
