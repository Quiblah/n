The field due to Q at the location q, is:

E = F/q = Qq / 4&pi;&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>r<sup>2</sup>q  = Q /
4&pi;&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>r<sup>2</sup>

E is a vector, just like F.

Points in the direction of force on a +ve charge.

### Example
What is the E-field an electron experiences in a hydrogen atom?

-ignore e charge

-only care about p

r = 5.29x10<sup>-11</sup>

E = 8.99x10<sup>9</sup> .
(1.6x10<sup>-19</sup>)/(5.29x10<sup>-11</sup>)<sup>2</sup>

= 5.14x10<sup>11</sup>Nc<sup>-1</sup>

### Example 2

q<sub>1</sub> (1.5mC) separated from q<sub>2</sub> (2.3mC) by 13cm.

What is the position P between them where E is 0.

<E<sub>2</sub>---P---E<sub>1</sub>>  want |E<sub>1</sub>| = |E<sub>2</sub>|

so:

q<sub>1</sub>/x<sup>2</sup> = q<sub>2</sub>/(13-x)<sup>2</sup>

x = 13sqrt(q<sub>1</sub>)/sqrt(q<sub>1</sub>) + sqrt(q<sub>2</sub>)

x = 5.8cm


What if one of the charges was negative?

The charges won't cancel.

This is called an electric dipole
