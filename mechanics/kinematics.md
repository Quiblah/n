### For 0 acceleration

y = a + bx

s = s`0 + vt

### For constant non-zero acceleration

Parabolic given by:

y = a + bx + cx^2        <--second kinematic relationship

s = s`0 + v`0t + 1/2(at^2)

### changing acceleration

Average velocity - slope of the straight line between the start and endpoints  
=delta(s) / delta(t)

Instantaneous velocity - slope of the tangent at any point

= ds/dt


## Velocity-time graphs

Gradient gives information about acceleration.

Area under curve is change in displacement.

### For constant acceleration

y = a + bx

*v = u + at*

### For changing acceleration

slope of the straight line between the start and endpoints  

instantaneous acc is slope of the tangent:

dv/dt


## Kinematic relationships
v = u + at

s = ut + 0.5at^2

v^2 = u^2 + 2as

u - initial velocity  
v - final velocity  
s - displacement  
a - acceleration  

### Deriving v = u +at
a = dv/dt

integrate both sides

[v] = [at]

v-u = at -a(0)

v = u + at

### Deriving s = ut + 0.5at^2
ds/dt = v

ds/dt = u + at

as = (u + at)dt

[s] = [ut + 0.5at^2]  (from t to 0)

s =  ut + 0.5at^2

### Deriving v^2 = u^2 + 2as

v = u + at   rearrrange for t and sub into s = ut +0.5at^2

### Kinematic relationships for constant acceleration in one direction
Can replace acceleration with x (as in movement along x axis)

### When solving problems:
* decide which direction is +ve
* Ensure anything in opposite direction is negative
* sketch
* Time isn't negative

###Example
A stone is thrown from a roof with initial velocity of 20m/s upwards. It then
falls off the roof to the ground.
- determine the time at which the stone reaches it's maximum height.

u = 20  
v = 0  
t = ?  
a = -9.81  

0 = 20 - 9.81(t)  
t = 20/9.81  
= 2.04s  

###Example
Car travelling at 45m/s passes a motorbike, 1 second after, the motorbike
accelerates at 3.00ms^-2. How long until it catches up.

s = ut + 0.5at^2

45t + 45 = 0 + 0.5(3)(t^2)

1.5t^2 - 45t -45 = 0

t^2 -30t -30 = 0

t = 31s 

## Relative velocity
b is a ball thrown forward at 15m/s on a 15m/s train (t), you (y) are a
stationary observer.

V<sub>b/t</sub> = 15m/s

V<sub>t/y</sub> = 15m/s

V<sub>b/y</sub> = 30m/s
