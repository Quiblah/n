## displacement-time graphs
Gradient is velocity.

### For 0 acceleration

y = a + bx

s = s`0 + vt

### For constant non-zero acceleration

Parabolic given by:

y = a + bx + cx^2        <--second kinematic relationship

s = s`0 + v`0t + 1/2(at^2)

### changing acceleration

Average velocity - slope of the straight line between the start and endpoints  
=delta(s) / delta(t)

Instantaneous velocity - slope of the tangent at any point

= ds/dt


## Velocity-time graphs

Gradient gives information about acceleration.

Area under curve is change in displacement.

### For constant acceleration

y = a + bx

*v = u + at*

### For changing acceleration

slope of the straight line between the start and endpoints  

instantaneous acc is slope of the tangent:

dv/dt


## Kinematic relationships
v = u + at

s = ut + 0.5at^2

v^2 = u^2 + 2as

u - initial velocity  
v - final velocity  
s - displacement  
a - acceleration  

### Deriving v = u +at
a = dv/dt

integrate both sides

[v] = [at]

v-u = at -a(0)

v = u + at

### Deriving s = ut + 0.5at^2
ds/dt = v

ds/dt = u + at

as = (u + at)dt

[s] = [ut + 0.5at^2]  (from t to 0)

s =  ut + 0.5at^2
