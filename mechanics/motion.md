# Newtons laws

* If no net force acts on an object it's acceleration will be 0.
* If a net force actos on an onject, the object accelerates. The direction of
  acceleration is the same as the direction of the net force.
* The mass of the body times the acceleration vector of the body equals the net
  force vector.

# Superposition of forces
> We can combine multiple forces by summing the components of the forces to
> create a single net force.

## Example: 3 forces acting on a point.
f1: 210N at 227<sup>o</sup>  
f2: 60N at 0<sup>o</sup>  
f3: 120N at 90<sup>o</sup>  

f1<sub>x</sub> = -210(cos(47))  
= -143N

f1<sub>y</sub> = 210(sin(47))  
= 153N

resultant x = 60 - 143 = -83

resultant y = 34N

**Total resultant force = 89.7N**

tan(a) = 34/83

**a = 22.3<sup>o</sup>**
