## Newtons law of gravity
If you have m<sub>1</sup> and m<sub>2</sub> separated by distance r then there
will be a force between them:

F = G m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub> / r<sup>2</sup>

* G is a positive constant.
* Mass is always positive.
* The force is always attractive.
* Force directional along r.
* Force equal on both masses but opposite.
* if r increases by a factor of 2, the force decreases by 4 (1/r<sup>2</sup>
  law).
* Both bodies experience the force.

### What if the masses aren't not points?
i.e. a person on the earth:

The person is attracted to every small point each with it's own distance r. The
net force is the total of all these forces.

The result of this is that you can treat the mass as a single point (if it is
spherical). 

G = 6.674 x 10<sup>-11</sup> N.m<sup>2</sup>/kg<sup>2</sup>

### Example 1
Gravitational force of earth on a person:

Person m1 = 80kg

Earth m2 = 5.97 x 10<sup>24</sup>

radius re = 6.38 x 10<sup>6</sup>

F = Gm1m2/r<sup>2</sup>

= 783N

What about when on the ISS?

ri = re + 350km


F = Gm1m2/ri<sup>2</sup>

= 703N

### Example 2
At what distance into space do you weigh 1% of that on earth?

solution (a): force on earth = 783N      1% = 7.83N

F = Gm1m2/(re+r)<sup>2</sup>

re+r = sqrt(Gm1m2/F)

r = sqrt(Gm1m2/F) - re

= 57000km

solution (b): F1 = Gm1m2/r<sup>2</sup>  F2 = Gm1m2/r<sup>2</sup>

F1/F2 = 1%

R2 = RE.sqrt(F1/F2)

R2 = 10RE

## Weight
weight: F<sub>g</sub> = GM<sub>g</sub>m/r<sub>e</sub><sup>2</sup>

F = ma:

ma = GM<sub>g</sub>m/r<sub>e</sub><sup>2</sup>

a = GM/r<sup>2</sup>

## Gravitational fields
B experiences gravitational force from A if it is in the field of a.

> Field = force per unit mass

i.e. For gravity:   field = F<sub>g</sub>/m  =
Gm<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub>/r<sup>2</sup>m<sub>2</sub>  =
Gm<sub>1</sup>/r<sup>2</sup>

Or field strength = g 

### Example
At what point between the earth and the moon is the total gravitational field 0?

Gm/d<sup>2</sup> = Gm<sub>m</sub>/(rem-d)<sup>2</sup>

m<sub>m</sub> . d<sup>2</sup> = m<sub>e</sub> . (rem-d)<sup>2</sup>

d = sqrt(m<sub>e</sub>).rem / sqrt(m<sub>e</sup> + sqrt(m<sub>m</sub>)

d = 0.9rem

## Gravitational potential energy
potential energy E<sub>p</sub> = mgh

- only in a constant gravitational field.

> U = -Gm<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub>/r


To move an object upwards on earth we give it energy.

So U is always negative.

### Example 
How much energy to take a 5000kg rocket to the moon.

Initial PE on earth = -Gm<sub>e</sub>m/r

PE at moon = -Gm<sub>e</sub>m/r<sub>em</sub>

Difference in PE = -GM<sub>e</sub>m (1/rem -1/re)

= 3x10<sup>11</sup>J

notice positive.
