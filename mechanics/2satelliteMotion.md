## Newtons cannon
Cannon on a mountain fires a projectile at a tangent to the curve of the earth.

* At a small velocity it would hit the earth
* At a very large velocity it would leave the earth
* At a medium velocity it would fall at the same rate the earth is curving away
  from it and orbit the earth.

The projectile is kept in orbit by its initial velocity.


## Circular orbits
A mass m in a circular orbit has velocity v and F<sub>g</sub> (gravity pulling
towards earth) and F<sub>c</sub> (centrifugal force as result of the velocity).

For a stable orbit F<sub>c</sub> = F<sub>g</sub>

a<sub>c</sub> = v<sup>2</sup>/r therefore:

F<sub>c</sub> = mv<sup>2</sup>/r

Gm<sub>e</sub>/r<sup>2</sup> = v<sup>2</sup>

> v = sqrt(GM<sub>e</sub>/r)   <-- Velocity of a satellite.

What is a satellites period?

period of revolution T = 2&pi;r/v

T = 2&pi;r.sqrt(r/GM<sub>e</sub>)

T = 2&pi;r<sup>3/2</sup>/sqrt(GM<sub>e</sub>)

### Example
What is the speed and orbital period of the moon? Assume r<sub>em</sub> =
384000km

v = sqrt(GM<sub>e</sub>/r)

= 1018ms<sup>-1</sup>

~1kms<sup>-1</sup>

T = 2&pi;r/v = 2&pi;(384000x10<sup>3</sup>)/1018 = 27.4 days  <--kinda rightish

### Geostationary orbits
A satellite which orbits in the same direction as the rotation of the earth
directly above the equator with a period of exactly 1 day.

T = 2&pi;sqrt(r<sup>3</sup>/GM<sub>e</sub>)

r = root3(GT<sup>2</sup>M<sub>e</sub>/4&pi;<sup>2</sup>)

1 day = 8.69x10<sup>4</sup>

r = 4.22x10<sup>7</sup>m  (From center of the earth)

Therefore altitude of satellite = 4.22x10<sup>7</sup>m - radius of earth

= 35786km
