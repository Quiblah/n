### Example
Ball launched from ground with velocity of 24ms<sup>-1</sup> at and angle of
30<sup>o</sup>. How far does it travel horizontally?

Upwards component is 24sin(30) = 12

v=12  
u=0  
a=9.81  
t=?  

v=u+at

12=0+9.81t

t=1.2232s

total time = 2t = 2.446s

Horizontal component is 24cos(30) = 20.7846ms<sup>-1</sup>

distance = s*t = **50.84m**
