&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>   permittivity of free space.

&mu;<sub>0</sub>    permeability of free space.

speed of light = 1 / sqrt(&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>&mu;<sub>0</sub>)

= 3.00x10<sup>8</sup>

This is always constant, no matter the movement of the source.

This means some of newtons theories need to be expanded on because they would
put no maximum speed.

Einstein's two postulates that make up the special theory of relativity:

* The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of
  their relative frame of reference.
* The laws of physics don't change even in an inertial (constant velocity)
  reference frame.

&Delta;t = &Delta;t<sub>0</sub>  /  sqrt(1 - v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)

t<sub>0</sub> = proper time  -  The observed time for the moving observer
measured in the frame of reference of the event. Shorter time is measured.

t = observed time for the stationary observer measured in a relatively moving
frame of reference. Longer time is measured.

## Time dilation
### Example
&Delta;t<sub>0</sub> = 2.2x10<sup>-6</sup>s

v = 0.99c

&Delta;t = 2.2x10<sup>-6</sup>  /  sqrt(1 - 0.99c<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)

= 15.6&mu;s


### ?
This means that time and space must be able to change.

l = l<sub>0</sub>sqrt(1 - v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)


l<sub>0</sub> = proper time  -  The observed length for the moving observer
measured in the frame of reference of the event. Longer length is measured.

l = observed length for the stationary observer measured in a relatively moving
frame of reference. Shorter length is measured.
