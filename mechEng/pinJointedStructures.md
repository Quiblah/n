## Assumptions
All joints are frictionless pins (can't resist rotation) therefore each member
is only subject to tensile or compressive forces (no bending).

Weight of the members is negligible.

Forces are only applied at the pins.

### 1. Method of joints
Working with the forces acting on each joint for internal forces.

Using moments for external forces.

### 2. Method of sections.
A section is *cut* which is experiencing a turning force.

To find the force on any one member we cut the section through that member.

Step 1: Draw the free body diagram.

Step 2: Find the reactions at the supports using moment equilibrium and force
equilibrium.

Step 3: Choose the section that cuts through the desired member and doesn't go
through more that 3 members with unknown forces.

Step 4: try to guess the directions of the unknown forces.

Step 5: Use 3 equilibrium equations on one section to find forces on the desired
member.
