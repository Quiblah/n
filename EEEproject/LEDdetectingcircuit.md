1.by using a potential divider.
2. <2.8V to 3.2V from data sheets
3. By measuring the resistance of the LDR when next to the LED and when shaded,
   then picking a resistor value that could then be tweaked when measuring the
voltage produced
4. ---
5. 4k7 , produces voltage from ~1.1V to ~4V.
6. Ambient light. Light from other LEDs.
7. Put the LEDs very close to the LDRs and have a good distance between each
   pair, use it in an area with low ambient light.
