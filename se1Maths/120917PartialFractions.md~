## partial fractions
### simple fractions
2 / x-1   +   5 / x+4 = ?  
> common denominator  

2x + 8 + 5x - 5  /  (x-1)(x+4)  

=  7x+3  /  (x-1)(x+4)


> We can combine algebraic fractions by putting them over common denominator  
## Now we need to do it backwards.  

7x+3  /  (x-1)(x+4)   =   A/ (x-1) + B/(x+4)  
  
> 7x+3  =  A(x+4) + B(x-1)  
Now solve that for A and B  
2 options:  
* x values that remove an A or B.
* compare coeffieceenints of x.
