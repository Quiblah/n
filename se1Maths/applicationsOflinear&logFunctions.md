> Extracting useful stuff from graphs

First, you plot data onto a graph

If you can make a straight line graph that is best. Because it is easy to get
stuff from.

y = mx + b

m - gradient

b - y intercept

## Example 3.2.1
How resistance (R) changes with temperature.

Proportional - straight line with positive gradient.

R = aT + b

b = 4.5

a = 0.025

R = 0.025T + 4.5

## Example 3.2.2
Experiment is made to test if t,y relate like so:

y = at<sup>2</sup> + b

The data does not create a straight line.

So instead we need to make it a straight line.

y = at<sup>2</sup> + b

x = t<sup>2</sup>

y = ax + b  <-- straight line :)

Now we plot y against x, giving a straight line graph.

a = 2

b = 3

y = 2x + 3  <-- because this works and a straight line was created,  we know the
assumption was correct.

**y = 2t<sup>2</sup> + 3**

## Example 3.2.3
Reduce each law to a straight line

* y = ax<sup>4</sup> + b

t = x<sup>4</sup>

y = at+b

* y = ax<sup>2</sup> + bx

y/x = ax + b

set Y = y/x, X=x

* y = ax + b/x<sup>2</sup>

yx<sup>2</sup> = ax<sup>3</sup> + b

set Y = yx<sup>2</sup> , X = x<sup>3</sup>

Y = aX + b

when x = 0, y: undefined

## Also logs:
y = ax<sup>b</sup>

How can that be made into a straiht line.

lny = ln(ax<sup>b</sup>)  
lny = ln(a) + bln(x)  <-- we now have a linear relation between lny and lnx.

lny = blnx + lna  
Y = bX + C
