How quickly does something change / slope of graph

### Straight line slope
Change in y / change in x.

### Slope of a curve
The slope at any one point of the curve is the gradient of the tangent of the
curve at that point.

### Calculate that from y = f(x)
y = x<sup>2</sup>


## Rules for differentiation
### chain rule
differentiate: (x<sup>2</sup> - 3x + 8)<sup>5</sup>

u = x<sup>2</sup> - 3x + 8

y = u<sup>5</sup>

dy/du = 5u<sup>4</sup>

du/dx = 2x - 3

dy/dx = dy/du . du/dx

= 5(2x-3)(x<sup>2</sup> - 3x + 8)<sup>5</sup>
