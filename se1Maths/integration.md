## Improper integrals
(ones with limits at infinity)

### An improper integral with a finite answer

I = integral from 0 to inf of e<sup>-23x</sup> .dx

lim r->inf  [-1/23 . e<sup>-23x</sup>] from 0 to R

= lim r->inf [1/23 - 1/23 . e<sup>-23R</sup>]

= 1/23


### An improper integral with an infinite answer

f(x) = 1/x

first integrate between 1 and R

= lim R->inf of [lnx] from 1 to R

the result in this case is infinite.

### Averages of continuous functions
How to find the average of f(x) between a and b?

The average height of a function, is the area under the function divided by the
base (b-a).

#### Example
y=1-x<sup>2</sup> from -1 to 1

1/2 ([x-x<sup>3</sup>/3] from -1 to 1)

= 1/2 ( 2/3 + 2/3 )  = 2/3

average of y=1-x<sup>2</sup> between -1 and 1 is 2/3
