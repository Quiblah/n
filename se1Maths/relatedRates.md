## Example
Liquid leaking from a tank into a circular puddle at 1cm<sup>3</sup> per second
the depth of the puddle is 0.1cm.

When the puddle has r = 5cm FInd rate of increase of the radius, area, and
circumference.

r = 5

h = 0.1

V = 0.1&pi;r<sup>2</sup>

A = &pi;r<sup>2</sup>

C = 2&pi;r

dV/dt = 1

dV/dt = dV/dr  .  dr/dt  = 1
