## Two events are disjoined (mutually exclusive) 
if they don't contain any outcomes in common.

A,B disjoined --> P(AnB) = 0 

> P(AuB) = P(A)+P(B)

For general A nd B, not necessarily disjoined:

> P(AuB) = P(A)+P(B)-P(AnB)

### Example 6.2.3
A={1,2,3,4} B={2,4,6}

equally probable, find P(AuB)

P(A) = 4/6     P(B) = 3/6     P(AnB) = 2/6

P(AuB) = 5/6

## Independent events
The outcome of each does not influence the others

P(AnBnCnDnE...) = P(A).P(B).P(C)...
