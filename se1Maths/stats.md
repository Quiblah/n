> One number is better than lots.

mean, median, mode. All give one number.

Another number could be how spread out they are:

Or how far away each measurement is from the mean value - standard deviation.

&sigma;<sup>2</sup> = 1/N-1 &Sigma;(x<sub>i</sub> - mean)<sup>2</sup> = VARIANCE

e.g.

5 7 8 1 9 12

N = 6, mean = 7

&sigma;<sup>2</sup> = 14

&sigma; = 3.74...

Can also be written as:

&sigma;<sup>2</sup> = 1/N-1 [&Sigma;x<sup>2</sup> - 1/N(&Sigma;x)<sup>2</sup>]
