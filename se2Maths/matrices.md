Normally AB != BA

Sometimes it is though:

A = 1  1  
   -1  1  

B = 3  2   
   -2  3  

A and B commute. Because AB = BA.

If A and B commute, then A and B are square of the same dimensions.

A = p.q

B = r.s

AB = (p.q)(r.s)

BA = (r.s)(p.q)

Therefore - p = s and r = q


Size of AB = q.q

AB = BA implies that AB and BA have same size. So p = q.

and A is p.p and B is also p.p


## Powers of matrices

A = 1 1
    1 1

A<sup>2</sup> = 1 1  .  1 1    =    2 2  
                1 1     1 1         2 2  

## Rotation matrices

R<sub>xy</sub> =  cos&theta;  sin&theta;  0  
                 -sin&theta;  cos&theta;  0  
                  0     0     0  

R<sub>xy</sub>(&pi;/2) = 0  1  0  
                        -1  0  0  
                         0  0  1  

v = 3
    4
    5


R<sub>xy</sub>v = 4
                 -3
                  5
