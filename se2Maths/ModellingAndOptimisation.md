## ex 1.17
A rectangle has perimeter of 16m. Find length of this sides so it has the
maximum area.

P = 2x + 2y = 16

y = 8-x

A = xy

A = x(8-x)

A = 8x - x<sup>2</sup>

Plan:

	1. Find stationary points

	2. Use second derivative test

	3. Check end points.

A' = 8-2x

A' = 0, x = 4

A'' = -2

A''(4) = -2   <-- local maximum

x>=0 and y>=0

0<=x<=8

x | A(x)
---|---
0|0
4|16
8|0

therefore max is at x=4 and y=4

(it's a square).
