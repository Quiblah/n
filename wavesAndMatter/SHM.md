## Ball on a spring

At the end of each oscillation there is 0KE and the potential energy is E = 1/2(kA<sup>2</sup>)

At the middle of the oscillation there is maximum kinetic energy KE = 1/2(mv<sub>max</sub><sup>2</sup>)

From that we can get: 

v<sub>max</sub>  =  +-A . sqrt(k/m)

A - amplitude

k - spring constant

m - mass


T = 2&pi; . sqrt(m/k)

f = 1/T

angular velocity = f . 2&pi;

&omega; = sqrt(k/m)

#### Position:

X = Acos(&omega;)t

X - horizontal position

A - amplitude

&omega; - angular velocity

t - time
