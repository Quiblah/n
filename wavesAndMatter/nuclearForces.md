### Forces within an nucleus
- Nucleus is about 10<sup>-15</sup>m across

- 2 Protons have:  
    - gravitational force
    - Electrostatic force

Gravitational force between the protons is ~10<sup>-35</sup>N.  

Electrostatic force: 

F<sub>E</sub> = q1.q2 / 4&pi;&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>r<sup>2</sup>

= 10<sup>3</sup>N     WOAHWAAOW.

This means there must be another force.

### dadadaDAAAA The STRONG force:

- Acts between nucleons 
- Very short range (~10<sup>-15</sup>)  
- Doesn't interact with electrons  
- about 100x strong than F<sub>E</sub>  
- No field lines, no 1/r<sup>2</sup>...  


--> Neutron  
- Neutral  
- Adds strong force  
- Stabilize large nuclei  

--> 4<sup>th</sup> Force  (Weak force)  
- Force used to stabilize unstable nuclei  
- Converts a proton to a neutron or a neutron to a proton.  
- Does that by releasing an electron.
