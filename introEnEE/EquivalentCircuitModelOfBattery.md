Batteries have an internal resistance r and a  source of voltage E.

An ideal batter would have r=0

When r is not 0 (always), current drawn from the battery causes a drop in
voltage over the internal resistance r.

When there is a load resistance R<sub>L</sub>:

V<sub>L</sub> = E - V<sub>r</sub> = E - I<sub>r</sub>
