1. Remove the load portion of the network across which the thevenin equiv. is to
   be found.
2. Mark the terminals of the remaining 2 terminal network.
3. Calculate R<sub>th</sub>: set all sources to zero and find the resultant
   resistance between the two marked terminals
4. Calculate V<sub>th</sub>: Return all sources to their original position and
   find the open circuit voltage between the marked terminals.
5. Draw the thevenin equivalent circuit with the removed portion replaced
   between the terminals of the equivalent circuit.
