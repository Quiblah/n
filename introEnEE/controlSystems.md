## Cascading blocks
A measuring system consists of a thermal transducer, an amplifier, and a chart
recorder. With the following sensitivities (gain):

&theta;<sub>i</sub>--->Transducer (0.25mV/<sup>o</sup>C--->Amplifier (2V/mV)--->Chart
recorder 5mm/V--->&theta;<sub>0</sub>

Determine the overall system sensitivity, and output deflection of the pen for a
10<sup>o</sup>C temperature change.

Sensitivity = K = K1xK2xK3

K = 0.25 mv/<sup>o</sup>C x 2 V/mV x 5 mm/V

= 2.5 mm/<sup>o</sup>C


&theta;<sub>0</sub> / &theta;<sub>i</sub> = K

K&theta;<sub>i</sub> = 2.5 mm/<sup>o</sup>C x 10<sup>o</sup>C

&theta;<sub>0</sub> = 25mm
