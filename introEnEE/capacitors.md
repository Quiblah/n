Switch initially at a. Ammeter reads 0. Voltmeter reads 0.

Switch moves to b at time t<sub>1</sub>.

When switch moves from a to b, there is no change, because the capacitor just
stays charged.

At time t<sub>3</sub> the switch moves to c, this creates a closed loop for the
capacitor with a 1M&ohm; resistor.

This will create current in the opposite direction to before, until the voltage
across the plates is 0.


Capacitance is the ratio of the charge stored on one plate to the voltage
difference between the two plates.

C = Q/V

## Capacitors in parallel
*page 1.3*

Charge stored on C<sub>1</sub> = Q<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>1</sub>V

Charge stored on C<sub>2</sub> = Q<sub>2</sub> = C<sub>2</sub>V

C<sub>eq or total<sub> = Q/V = C<sub>1</sub>+C<sub>2</sub>

## Capacitors in series
*page 1.3*

Current is the same for both capacitors. Therefore the charge on the capacitors
must be the same.

Q<sub>1</sub> = V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub> = Q

Q<sub>2</sub> = V<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub> = Q

V<sub>1</sub> = Q/C<sub>1</sub>

V<sub>2</sub> = Q/C<sub>2</sub>

1/C<sub>eq</sub> = 1/C<sub>1</sub> + 1/C<sub>2</sub>

## Dimensions of capacitor and its capacitance.
Capacitance is proportional to the area of the plates.

The capacitors in series halve their capacitance because there is effectively
double the insulation

Capacitance is proportional to 1/distance.

C = &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>&epsilon;<sub>r</sub>A/d  (Farads)

A = area of plates

d = distance between plates

&epsilon;<sub>0</sub> = permittivity of free space = 8.85x10<sup>-12</sup>

&epsilon;<sub>r</sub> = Relative permittivity of the insulator (with respect to
that of free space).

If the insulator has a large &epsilon;<sub>r</sub> then the capacitance can be
greatly increased.

## Time constant of an RC circuit.
*page 1.4*

**T = RC**  time constant of ckt

indicates the speed at which charging takes place in the circuit.
