The contribution to the magnetic flux of a single turn is &Phi;<sub>1</sub>.

The magnitude of this flux s proportional to the current i.

&Phi; = N.k.i

From Faraday's law:

v(t) = kN<sub>2</sub> . di/dt

kN<sub>2</sub> ---> inductance (L).

v(t) = L . di(t)/dt

An inductor stores energy in it's B-field.

For a circuit with voltage source, inductor, and resistor:

E = V<sub>r</sub> + V<sub>L</sub>

E = Ri + L.di/dt

&#x222b;Ei.dt = &#x222b;Ri<sub>2</sub>.dt + &#x222b;Li.di

## Time constant of R-L circuit:
T = L/R

Tells us how fast changes can take place in a circuit with R and L.
