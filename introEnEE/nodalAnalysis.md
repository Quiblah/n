Used when a network has lots of current sources.

A node is defined as a junction of 2 or more branches.

If we define any one node as a reference node (a point at 0V) the remaining
nodes will have a fix potential relative to this reference.

Steps:

1. Determine the number of nodes within the network.
2. Select a reference node and label all other nodes
3. Assume the node voltages as V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub> etc.
4. Write KCL at each node except the reference.
5. Solve the resulting equations for node voltages.
