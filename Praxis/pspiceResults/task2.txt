a. Gain of amplifier at mid volume point (same .out as task1): 
Original: 10mV
Amplified: 268.448mV
Gain: 258.448mV

b. Gain of amplifier at max volume:
Original: 10mV
Amplified: 510.281mV
Gain: 500.281mV

c. Gain of amplifier at min volume:
Original: 10mV
Amplified: 0mV
Gain: -10mV

1.2
resistor(kohms): 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0
amplitude(mV): 278.701, 240.362, 219.745, 194.410, 177.999, 168.023, 159.595
gain (dB): 28.90, 27.62, 26.84, 25.77, 25.01, 24.51, 24.06

1.3
The gain is internally set to 20 to keep
external part count low, but the addition of an external
resistor and capacitor between pins 1 and 8 will
increase the gain to any value from 20 to 200

2.1
Supply at 5V, waveform normal.
Supply at 4V, waveform normal.
Supply at 3.5V, waveform normal.
Supply at 3V, waveform distorted.
Matches reccommended supply voltage of 4-12V.

2.2
Battery will produce less voltage as it runs down, this could lead to the
amplifier malfunctioning.
