<h2 id="1introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>This session was used as a opportunity to familiarise ourselves with the usage
of an oscilloscope to analyse waveforms.  We started by recording the details of
6 individual waveforms and then connected another channel and worked out the
phase shift between the two waveforms.</p>

<h2 id="2theory">2. Theory</h2>

<p>An electrical signal with a regularly changing Voltage will produce a regular
waveform. An oscilloscope can be used to graphically display the changes in
voltage over time, and also record certain attributes of the wave such as
frequency and peak voltage.</p>

<h2 id="3experimentalmethod">3. Experimental method</h2>

<p>For the first 3 waveforms the oscilloscope was connected to the signal panel
with a single BNC patch lead and the shape, Voltage levels, time period,
frequency and angular frequency were recorded (Table 1). For the next 3
waveforms the dc offset (V<sub>dc</sub>) was also recorded (Table 2).</p>

<p>Table 3 shows the results of comparing 3 sets of 2 waves. For each set of 2 the
frequency was measured, as was the time difference between the two waves
<em>&Delta;T</em>, and which wave was leading/lagging. This information can be used to
measure the phase difference <em>&phi;</em> with:</p>

<p><em>&phi;</em> = 360 x <em>&Delta;T</em> x <em>f</em></p>

<p>Alternatively, the digital oscilloscope could be set to display the phase
difference in degrees.</p>

<h2 id="5analysis">5. Analysis</h2>

<p>I am quite confident that the data collected from these waveforms was accurate,
though there was one irregularity - the value for <em>&phi;</em> that I calculated from
time difference and frequency differed slightly from the value displayed by the
oscilloscope. The most likely cause of this would be that the measurements I
took for <em>&Delta;T</em> could have been slightly inaccurate.</p>
