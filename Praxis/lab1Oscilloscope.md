## 1. Introduction
This session was used as a opportunity to familiarise ourselves with the usage
of an oscilloscope to analyse waveforms.  We started by recording the details of
6 individual waveforms and then connected another channel and worked out the
phase shift between the two waveforms.

## 2. Theory
An electrical signal with a regularly changing Voltage will produce a regular
waveform. An oscilloscope can be used to graphically display the changes in
voltage over time, and also record certain attributes of the wave such as
frequency and peak voltage.

## 3. Experimental method
For the first 3 waveforms the oscilloscope was connected to the signal panel
with a single BNC patch lead and the shape, Voltage levels, time period,
frequency and angular frequency were recorded (Table 1). For the next 3
waveforms the dc offset (V<sub>dc</sub>) was also recorded (Table 2).

Table 3 shows the results of comparing 3 sets of 2 waves. For each set of 2 the
frequency was measured, as was the time difference between the two waves
*&delta;T*. This information can be used to measure the phase difference *&phi;*
with:

*&phi;* = 360 x *&delta;T* x *f*
