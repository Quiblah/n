## Intro+objectives  
- Understanding of c  
- Proper use of the sensor  

## Theoretical background  
- How the sensor works  

## Experiments and results  
- Results of sensor testing  
- Problems that arise from function of sensor.

## Code  
- Proper comments.  
- Making clear what code is used.  
- Maybe explaining where problems arose.  

## Conclusions + critical analysis  
- FindObj worked very  well considering how much error the robot has.  
- Smoother avoidance could be achieved with more sensors.
